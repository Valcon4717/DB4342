# UTEP Instructors

This repository contains the codebase and documentation for the **UTEP Instructors** database management system. This project was developed for a **Database Management** course, leveraging **SQL**, **MySQL**, and **PHP** to design and implement a comprehensive system that tracks instructors, students, courses, research projects, and lab assignments.

## üìÑ About the Project

The UTEP Instructors project was designed to simulate a database system for managing information related to instructors and their associated entities within the Computer Science Department at the University of Texas at El Paso. The system includes functionalities for:

- Tracking personal information for instructors and students.
- Managing courses, labs, research projects, and budgets.
- Allowing administrators to add, modify, and delete records.
- Enabling viewers to access restricted non-sensitive data.
- Generating detailed reports on various entities.

### Key Features

- **Database Design:** Includes Entity-Relational Diagrams, relational models, and normalized schemas.
- **SQL Queries:** Complex queries to meet functional requirements like retrieving, updating, and reporting data.
- **User Interface:** Developed using **PHP** to interact with the MySQL database.
- **Team Effort:** This project was developed collaboratively by a team of four.
